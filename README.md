# linux-first-time-gaming-script
Simple script to make my linux installs more automated.

Not much since I'm shit at this but it may interest you.


# How to run
## 1.Installing git (If not already installed)
### Package Managers

```
Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git (flag -y means it will automatically confirm the command)

Arch Linux: sudo pacman -Syy --noconfirm && sudo pacman -S --noconfirm git (flag --noconfirm means that it won't ask yes/no)
```

# 2. Downloading and running the script

```
git clone https://github.com/An12854/linux-first-time-gaming-script.git

cd linux-first-time-gaming-script/

chmod +x script-install-(repository).sh

./script-install-(repository).sh
```
And that's it! If anything fails send an issue.
